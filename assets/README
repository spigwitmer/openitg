Directory layout
----------------

arcade-patch: contains startup scripts, X configuration, and kernel modules
	for arcade patches.

d4: contains the game data from the ITG drive. This should *not* be modified:
	all changes should go under patch-data, which is overlaid on this data
	by the game binary.

game-data: contains supporting data for OpenITG home releases (the 'home' theme
	and default config). This combined with d4 creates the root directory
	for OpenITG home releases.

patch-data: contains changed data in d4 across both arcade and home releases,
	This is compressed and encrypted into Data/patch/patch.zip; individual
	files are 'overloaded' in the d4 directory here. Make all changes to
	the core game data in this directory only.

utilities: various programs used for debugging, testing, reverse engineering,
	and so forth. Contains itg2-util for Linux, which handles dongle-based
	ITG data encryption/decryption; and patch-toolkit for Linux and Windows,
	which handles ITG patch encryption/decryption. Bring Your Own Compiler.

win32-installer: icons, config, and scripting for the Windows NSIS installer.
